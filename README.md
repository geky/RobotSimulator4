RobotSimulator4
===============

Why a new version? Well, I'm using a transform framework now for sensors and graphics, which will make it easy to create custom robots. I'm also using a "world" abstraction, which provides an interface for sensors and robots to access obstacles and lines. And, I'm actually writing Javascript without pretending it's Some Other Language!
